        <span style="color: red;">"A blockchain is a database that stores encrypted blocks of data then chains them together to form a chronological single-source-of-truth for the data.</span> Digital assets are distributed instead of copied or transferred,
        creating an immutable record of an asset. The asset is decentralized, allowing full real-time access and transparency to the public. A transparent ledger of changes preserves integrity of the document, which creates trust in the asset”.</h4>
