      <h1>More about SURAKSHA</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        We started SURAKSHA as a way to help charities get more donations. Plain
        and simple. It all started from an inspiration to create a website that
        would encourage people to donate to charity. We gathered some close
        friends and family and started brainstorming ideas and doing some
        research. There were some great websites for people who wanted to donate
        their time by volunteering or for people who wanted to donate money to a
        particular cause. What we did not find is a single great resource for
        people who wanted to donate to charity non-cash items, like clothing and
        household goods. As we began to study this subject we found that many
        charities will actually come to people’s homes and pick up the
        donations. It’s a free service. Most of us were not aware that charities
        offered donation pick up service. That was it. We found our niche:
        Create the best website for people to connect with charities and
        schedule a donation pick up. SURAKSHA is Free SURAKSHA is free for all
        charities and all donors. We do not take any monetary donations either.
        We’re here to help charities and donors connect. That’s it. SURAKSHA
        Staff and Volunteers SURAKSHA volunteers are comprised of accountants,
        lawyers, bankers, teachers, ministers, stay at home moms, and many
        people passionate about giving back to their community. Everyone brings
        their unique talents and perspectives to the table in order to ensure
        that SURAKSHA is the best resource on the web for people to donate
        clothing and household goods to charity. We would like to thank everyone
        who has volunteered their time and service SURAKSHA would not be
        possible without your help. Please support a local charity and make a
        donation today!

      <h1>OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS & ACHIEVEMENTS</h1>
      <br />
      <h2 id="h-1">Enabling Direct Impact Giving</h2>
      <br />
      <p id="p-1">
        When I began my career in development, organizations were just beginning
        to struggle with how they could cover operating expenses, while
        responding to the growing number of donors interested in designated
        giving. I have seen nonprofits demonstrate great flexibility and
        creativity in personalizing giving opportunities, while still ensuring
        they are covering the basics. For example, one of my clients, a private
        school, struggled with how to engage grandparents in its annual fund.
        Our firm recommended a “Grandparent Philanthropy Project.” Every new or
        increased dollar donated by grandparents was earmarked toward an
        educational initiative chosen by the Grandparents Committee, in
        consultation with the school’s administration. That collaboration
        ensured that the selected initiative added value to the school and, in
        most cases, coincided with expenses that were already anticipated. It
        also created the opportunity for grandparents to become more directly
        involved in decision-making, thereby strengthening their connection to
        the school as supporters. This school just successfully completed its
        second year of engaging grandparents in the process and providing value
        to students.

      <h2 id="h-2">Increased Accountability</h2>
      <br />
      <p id="p-2">
        In furtherance of their missions, nonprofits have become increasingly
        impact-driven. Planning, data analysis and performance evaluation have
        become much more commonplace as nonprofits strive to understand how
        effective they are (and how much more effective they can be) at meeting
        their mission. Updates to foundations and boards, as well as annual
        reports — while sometimes time-consuming and expensive to create –-
        ensure transparency and hold nonprofits accountable in realizing their
        goals. This transparency, accountability and demonstration of impact is
        increasingly demanded as younger generations with new perspectives rise
        into philanthropic roles. Nonprofits are meeting these new challenges
        with enthusiasm and leveraging the results to improve their work.

      <h2 id="h-3">Tapping Into the Power of Social Media</h2>
      <br />
      <p id="p-3">
        The power of the crowd was always a force with which to be reckoned. (If
        you haven’t read about how Joseph Pulitzer raised the remaining $100,000
        needed for the Statue of Liberty’s base in 1885 from 160,000 donors who
        responded to his plea in a newspaper, check it out). However, new
        technologies have provided vehicles to make crowdfunding extremely
        effective and relatively easy. In a few short years, the number of
        resources and available platforms has grown exponentially, enabling
        organizations to reach beyond their donor base to new audiences and
        raise more funds. By meeting them where they are, crowdfunding has
        mobilized Millennials, exciting a group that is difficult to engage in
        giving. While crowdfunding should never replace individual donor
        relationships, it is a valuable tool to augment a campaign.
